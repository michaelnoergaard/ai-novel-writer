    CHARACTER_FOCUS = "character_focus"      # Enhance character development  
    PACING_FOCUS = "pacing_focus"           # Optimize story pacing
    COHERENCE_FOCUS = "coherence_focus"     # Improve logical flow
    GENRE_FOCUS = "genre_focus"             # Strengthen genre conventions
    COMPREHENSIVE = "comprehensive"          # Balanced improvement across all dimensions
```

### 2. **Advanced Quality Metrics and Feedback**

#### **Expanded Quality Assessment**
```python
class AdvancedQualityMetrics(BaseModel):
    # Core V1.3 metrics (enhanced)
    overall_score: float  # 0-10 overall quality
    structure_score: float  # Narrative arc assessment
    coherence_score: float  # Logical consistency
    genre_compliance: float  # Genre convention adherence
    character_development: float  # Character depth and consistency
    pacing_quality: float  # Story rhythm and tension
    theme_integration: float  # Theme incorporation
    
    # V1.4 enhancements
