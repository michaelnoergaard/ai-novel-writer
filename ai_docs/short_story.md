A short story is a brief work of prose fiction that typically focuses on a single incident, character, or effect. It's designed to be read in one sitting and creates a unified impression.
Length
Short stories generally range from 1,000 to 7,500 words, though there's some flexibility:

Flash fiction: Under 1,000 words (sometimes as short as 100-300 words)
Traditional short story: 1,000-7,500 words
Novelette: 7,500-17,500 words (longer than a short story, shorter than a novella)

Reading Time
Most short stories take 15 minutes to 1 hour to read, depending on length and reading speed. This "single sitting" quality is one of the form's defining characteristics.
Structure
Short stories typically follow a compressed structure:

Opening: Immediate establishment of character, setting, or conflict
Rising action: Quick development of tension or conflict
Climax: The crucial moment or turning point
Resolution: Swift conclusion, often leaving some elements open to interpretation

Unlike novels, short stories rarely have subplots and focus intensively on one central element.
Narrative Style
Short stories tend to be:

Economical: Every word counts; there's no room for excess
Focused: Usually one point of view, limited time frame
Immediate: Often start close to the climactic moment
Suggestive: Rely on implication and subtext rather than explicit explanation

Story Arc
The arc in short stories is typically:

Compressed: The entire emotional or dramatic journey happens quickly
Single effect: Edgar Allan Poe's concept that every element should contribute to one unified effect
Epiphanic: Often builds toward a moment of realization or revelation
Open-ended: May conclude with ambiguity, leaving readers to ponder the implications

The short story form excels at capturing a slice of life, a crucial moment, or a psychological state with precision and intensity.
