Collaborative Writing Stage: Multiple Authors/Writers
Developing the Initial Concept, Characters, and Plot:

Brainstorming sessions: Writers meet (in-person or virtually) to generate ideas collectively
Concept ownership: May rotate who leads different story elements - one writer champions the main character, another develops the setting
Plot mapping: Collaborative outlining using shared documents or whiteboards where each writer contributes plot points
Character creation: Writers may "adopt" specific characters, developing their backgrounds, voices, and motivations
Vision alignment: Regular check-ins to ensure all collaborators share the same story goals and tone

Writing Multiple Drafts (3-5 Revisions):

Sequential drafting: Writer A completes first draft, Writer B does second revision, Writer C handles third, etc.
Section-based collaboration: Each writer takes responsibility for specific scenes or chapters
Parallel drafting: Multiple writers simultaneously work on different versions, then merge the best elements
Specialty revision rounds: One writer focuses on dialogue revision, another on descriptive passages, another on plot tightening
Version control: Using tools like Google Docs or collaborative writing software to track changes and maintain draft history

Self-Editing for Story Structure, Pacing, and Character Development:

Distributed expertise: Each collaborator brings different editorial strengths - one excels at pacing, another at character consistency
Cross-checking: Writers review each other's sections for continuity and voice consistency
Structural meetings: Regular sessions to assess overall story arc and identify structural problems
Character voice consistency: Designated "voice keeper" ensures each character sounds consistent across different writers' sections
Pacing coordination: Writers analyze how their individual sections affect overall story rhythm
